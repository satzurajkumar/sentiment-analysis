Movie Review Sentiment Analysis✨ Project OverviewThis project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of IMDb movie reviews. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their text content. It utilizes TF-IDF for feature extraction and various machine learning models from scikit-learn for classification.🚀 FeaturesData Loading & Preprocessing: Reads movie review data from a CSV file using Pandas.Text Cleaning: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stop word removal, and potentially stemming/lemmatization.Feature Extraction: Employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.Sentiment Classification: Trains and evaluates machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression from scikit-learn) to predict sentiment.Evaluation: Reports classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).📊 DatasetThe project uses a CSV file containing IMDb movie reviews. Each entry typically includes the review text and a corresponding sentiment label (e.g., 'positive', 'negative').Expected File: imdb_reviews.csv (or similar, you can specify the exact name in the instructions)Format: CSV with at least two columns: one for the review text and one for the sentiment label.📁 File Structure.

🛠️ Setup and InstallationClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:On macOS and Linux:source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK data:You might need to download necessary NLTK data like 'punkt' and 'stopwords'. Run Python and use the NLTK downloader:import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# nltk.download('wordnet')
# nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
🏃 How to RunMake sure your dataset file (imdb_reviews.csv) is placed in the data/ directory.Run the main Python script:python src/sentiment_analyzer.py
The script will load the data, preprocess it, train the model, evaluate it, and print the results.📦 DependenciesThe project relies on the following Python libraries, listed in requirements.txt:pandasscikit-learnnltk(Add any other libraries your script uses)
